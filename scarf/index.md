My dear,
Your love is pink,
Makes me shy like a maiden in first love.
My heart is as sweet as honey.

Your love is soft as alpaca,
Makes my heart warm,
Be wrapped in your thick love like, forget the cold of winter.

Dear, we are so far away,
Your love is just around the corner.
Tonight I will sleep happily!
Dream and you meet!
