        <h1 class="title">A Village in Winter</h1>

        <p>The snow that did not melt was particularly bright and white under the sunlight. From a distance, the whole field was dotted with mottled snow. Against the blue sky, the surroundings felt very cold.</p>
<p>Village houses, there are still some snow melt water drip down along the eaves, families are very high walls, the doors are closed, the chicken does not call the dog bark, occasionally a wall foot has a sunny place, two or three old man, crouching or standing, wearing dark old cotton-padded jacket, his hands crossed in sleeve cage, or corners of the mouth of a cigarette. Occasionally there were a few words of communication, off and on. The whole village was immersed in silence. There were few young people and children in the village. Most of these old people are in their 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>Once in a while, I saw the door of a house open. A woman in her eighties was sitting inside, basking in the sunshine, looking at her feet and not looking out for a long time. She was used to this silence. Her home has six rooms and two small rooms in front of it that serve as a kitchen and bathroom. She has so many rooms by herself that her children occasionally come back to visit her. She is far from the only old person living alone in the village. There are also empty houses where the elderly have gone to the city to take care of their children and the doors have been locked for six months.</p>
<p>Along the village of a few staggered road to go a circle, only to see a few squatting wall at the root of the sun, in addition, nothing. This is the village in winter! It felt as if all this would soon disappear! Nature will devour everything here one day!</p>
