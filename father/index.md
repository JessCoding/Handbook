title: My Foodie Father
---

Every cold winter came, I missed my father more and more. To use today's young people's expression, my father is a veritable foodie, not only delicious, but also can eat.

There is a family in the village is specialized in killing sheep to sell mutton, winter arrived, the male master began to collect sheep everywhere to kill sheep. His mutton was sold in small towns. People in the village can't even afford to eat pork. How can they afford mutton? However, my brothers and sisters and I can eat.

Poor then, how poor? People buy meat are scrambling to buy more fat, because of the oil, claw bones and so on no one wants, which points more bones lean meat, that is to quarrel. Every year when the production team divides the pork, it is necessary to match the fat meat, lean meat and bones, and then everyone draws lots, so as to avoid the unpleasant thing.
No one wanted the sheep's head and feet in this family. My father could buy a sheep's head for one yuan, sometimes even 50 cents, if he had killed many sheep.

After buying the sheep's head, my father began to be busy, burning coal stove, cleaning, cooking soup, looking for soup ingredients, such as vermicelle, coriander, tofu, radish can go fishy, etc., the kitchen was filled with the smell of lamb soup, floating all over the house.

Sometimes it was so late that we were about to go to bed, but everyone waited patiently, especially me. Father put the cooked soup on the table, and the children gathered around the table. Father divided the meat from the sheep's head to us and mother. Grandma went to bed early, and mother brought a small bowl to grandma's bed.

Late at night, the three of us went to our room full of drinks and went to bed. After serving grandma, mother and father cleaned up together and went back to the room to sleep. The night was quiet again.

The lamb's feet soup is even more flavorful than the lamb's head soup. Once my father bought four sheep's feet for a dollar. The father was busy all afternoon, because the wool on the sheep's feet was very difficult to deal with, the father first scalded with boiling water, with small tweezers. Sometimes the hot is not good, it is difficult to remove the hair on the claws, father put the lamb's feet on the coal stove to bake, clean up and then put into the casserole soup.
Sheep claw soup has a gum, soup fat and thick, into the vermicelle, sheep's blood, coriander, do not mention how delicious!
As I grew older, there were special restaurants in the town to eat mutton soup, and some people began to know the delicacy of mutton head soup and mutton paw soup.

Nowadays, the price of sheep head and feet is the same as that of mutton, more than 40 yuan per kilogram. Who wants to buy sheep's feet alone, they don't sell it!

Eating delicious food is an essential thing in winter to drive away the cold and warm the heart.

One winter, the production team fished together. In a big pond, they caught a lot of spiral spiral herring. The big one weighed more than 20 jin and the body of the fish was as long as a shoulder pole. How do you divide the fish? Divide the fish into several sections, match the head and tail of the fish according to the size of the sections, and divide them by drawing lots. The rest of the fish intestines no one wants, my father took these home, with scissors to cut open the fish intestines, wash clean, and then with pickles and it braised in brown sauce, put a big pot on the table, wow, can be called delicious! Each of us had two more bowls of rice for that meal! Fish oil is also very fat, but not so greasy as lard, pickles lubricated by fish oil taste better, delicious and next meal!

After I got married and went to the city to live, my father and mother lived with me. In winter, my father went to the vegetable market to pick up some herring intestines and came back to cook pickles. As we ate, we laughed and talked, reflecting on the past happiness.

After a certain age, what you eat is a memory.

The greatest luck in my life is to have a father who is a foodie. In a time of extreme poverty and deprivation, you made my childhood feel like heaven!

Love you, miss you, my most respected father!
