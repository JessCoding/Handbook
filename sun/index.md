title: My Sun

My love, my sun
I am tired, I sigh,
My sweetheart,
A loud laugh from you,
Is enough to make the sky brighter.

I am depressed, I am listless,
My love,
Your bare, shining skin,
It's enough to make my eyes shine again.

Your eyes,
Your smile,
Your merry voice,
The smack smack sound you kiss...
As long as there is one,
Is enough to satisfy me, to make me happy,

Darling, you are my sun!
